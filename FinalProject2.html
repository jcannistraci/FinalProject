    <h2> Who are the Happy Helpers?</h2>

    <p id="two"> So glad you asked! We are a team of behind the scene people, and on the front line completely solar powered robots here to help! 
         Want to know more? 
        We have designed, prototyped, and built eco friendly robots to help clean up sidewalks, streets, and highways. The best part? It's not just streets!
        Some of our robots can do off roading too! They can go to public beaches, the edges of small waterways, and off road into the wilderness to clean.
    </p>

    <h3> It sounds great, but How? </h3>

    <p id="two"> Our robots are able to pick up and carry over 100 pounds of garbage in one trip. Each robot comes with a portable pod, that can hold 10,000 pounds of garbage! What else?
        Not only can it hold garbage, it can sort it too, recyclables? Yes we can. Compostable items? Even better! But wait, there is more! The pod is also designed with solar panel 
        and to store solar energy. That means, our robots can charge and recharge at the pods any time its necessary. Once finished? They self deploy to keep cleaning! </p>
    
    <h3> Ok, I like it so far, why did you choose solar energy?</h3>

    <p id="two"> We love the question! We don't want to bore you with details, so to be brief, in order for something to be
        sustainable it must meet the 3 P's. People, Planet, Profit. For our purposes Solar really fit our needs (people), 
        was the most cost effective (profit) and the life span of the solar panels proved to be way less harmful to our planet.
        Bottom line, what's sustainable for one thing, doesn't mean its the sustainable choice for all. We urge everyone to consider
        being more sustainable in whichever way it best fits People, Planet, and Profit. There is no right answer. </p>
