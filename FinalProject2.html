    <h1> Who are the Happy Helpers?</h1>

    <p> So glad you asked! We are a team of behind the scene people, and on the front line completely solar powered robots here to help! 
        Want to know more? 
        We have designed, prototyped, and built eco friendly robots to help clean up sidewalks, streets, and highways. The best part? It's not just streets!
        Some of our robots can do off roading too! They can go to public beaches, the edges of small waterways, and off road into the wilderness to clean.
    </p>

    <h3> It sounds great, but How? </h3>

    <p> Our robots are able to pick up and carry over 100 pounds of garbage in one trip. Each robot comes with a portable pod, that can hold 10,000 pounds of garbage! What else?
        Not only can it hold garbage, it can sort it too, recyclables? Yes we can. Compostable items? Even better! But wait, there is more! The pod is also designed to store solar energy.
        That means, our robots can charge and recharge at the pods any time its necessary. Once finished? They self deploy to keep cleaning! While our robots can store some energy, it unfortunately
        will not be enough to sustain them for prolonged periods.
